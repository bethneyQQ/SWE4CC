Now I understand the problem! The `_handle_finite_sets` method:
1. Separates finite sets from other sets at line 1320
2. Sorts finite sets by length at line 1324
3. Takes the smallest finite set `s` at line 1325
4. For each element `x` in `s`, checks if it's contained in all other sets (line 1331-1332)

When we have `Intersection({1}, {1}, {x})`:
- `fs_args` = `[{1}, {1}]` (two copies of {1})
- After sorting, `s = {1}` (the first one)
- `fs_args = [{1}]` (the second one)
- `other = [{x}]`
- For element `1` in `s`, it checks if `1` is in `fs_args + other = [{1}, {x}]`
- But when checking against `{x}`, the result is `None` (unknown), so `1` goes to `unk` list
- Then the symbolic handling logic kicks in, but since `{1}` has the same symbolic elements as `s` (none), it removes `1` from `unk`
- Result: `EmptySet()`

The fix is simple: remove duplicates from `args` before passing to `_handle_finite_sets`. This should be done at the beginning of `simplify_intersection`.

Let me prepare the patch:

## Analysis

The issue occurs in the `simplify_intersection` function. When duplicate sets are present in the intersection (e.g., `Intersection({1}, {1}, {x})`), the `_handle_finite_sets` method treats them as distinct sets and incorrectly determines containment, leading to an incorrect result of `EmptySet()`. The fix is to remove duplicates from the args early in the `simplify_intersection` function, before calling `_handle_finite_sets`.
