Based on the issue description in the file, I can see the problem clearly:

## Bug Analysis

**Issue**: The `RangeSlider.set_val()` method attempts to set `xy[4]` for a polygon that only has 4 vertices (indexed 0-3).

**Root Cause**: 
- Lines 1174 and 1180 in the `set_val` method try to set `xy[4] = .25, val[0]` (vertical) and `xy[4] = val[0], .25` (horizontal)
- However, the polygon created by `ax.axhspan()` and `ax.axvspan()` (lines 980, 990) only has 4 vertices

**Solution**:
The polygon needs 5 vertices to form a closed shape properly. Looking at lines 980 and 990, when creating the polygon:
- `self.poly = ax.axhspan(valinit[0], valinit[1], 0, 1, **kwargs)` (vertical)
- `self.poly = ax.axvspan(valinit[0], valinit[1], 0, 1, **kwargs)` (horizontal)

These create rectangles with 4 corners. However, matplotlib polygons need the first vertex repeated as the 5th vertex to close the path properly.

**The Fix**:
Lines 1174 and 1180 should NOT be commented out (as the user suggested). Instead, the polygon initialization needs to ensure it has 5 vertices from the start. The `axhspan` and `axvspan` methods should create polygons with 5 vertices where the 5th vertex equals the 1st vertex to close the shape.

However, looking at the actual issue more carefully: the `set_val` method is called during `__init__` (line 1046), and at that point the polygon from `axhspan`/`axvspan` only has 4 vertices. The lines trying to set `xy[4]` are attempting to close the polygon path, but they're doing so on a polygon that wasn't initialized with enough vertices.

**Correct Solution**: 
The lines 1174 and 1180 setting `xy[4]` ARE correct for closing the polygon path, but they fail because the polygon doesn't have a 5th vertex yet. The fix is to ensure the polygon has 5 vertices before trying to modify the 5th one. This means the issue is not in `set_val()` but in how the polygon is created or how `set_val()` handles the initial setting.

The user's suggestion to comment out lines 1174 and 1180 would work but isn't the cleanest solution - it leaves the polygon path unclosed, which could cause rendering issues.
