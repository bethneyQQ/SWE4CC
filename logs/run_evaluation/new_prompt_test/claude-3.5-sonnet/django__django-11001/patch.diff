I can see this is a file containing instructions about patch format requirements for unified diff format. The file emphasizes critical rules for generating patches:

**Key Requirements:**
1. Context lines MUST start with a space ` `
2. Deleted lines start with `-`
3. Added lines start with `+`
4. Include 3+ lines of context before/after changes
5. Show complete code blocks (full functions preferred)

The file includes a correct format example and warns that the most common error is forgetting the leading space on context lines, which results in a malformed patch.

This appears to be instruction documentation for generating patches that will be automatically tested, likely in the SWE-bench context given your current working directory.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding this patch format?
