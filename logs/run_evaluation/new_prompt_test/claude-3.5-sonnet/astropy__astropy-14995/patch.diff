I can see you've shared a file containing instructions about patch format requirements for unified diff format. This appears to be guidance for generating properly formatted patches for the SWE-bench evaluation system.

The key requirements highlighted are:

1. **Context lines must start with a space** ` ` (this is the most common error)
2. Deleted lines start with `-`
3. Added lines start with `+`
4. Include 3+ lines of context before/after changes
5. Show complete code blocks (full functions preferred)

The example shows the correct format where unchanged context lines have a leading space character, which is critical for the patch to be valid.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding patch generation or the SWE-bench evaluation system?
